# Intro

This setup is intended for presenting my css-examples in the most minimalistic way possible.

Thus I removed any need for building engines and compiled all code to native html+css with no JS, templates, frameworks, etc.

For more live examples you can visit links, attached to the section titles.

# Compatible browsers

All examples can be viewed on all latest evergreen browsers plus IE as a bonus!
